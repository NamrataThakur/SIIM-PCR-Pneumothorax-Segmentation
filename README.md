# SIIM-PCR-Pneumothorax-Segmentation

Business Problem:
Pneumothorax is a medical condition which arises when air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of the lung and makes it collapse. Thus, pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a portion of the lungs may be collapsed. Pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt chest injury, damage from underlying lung disease, or sometimes for no obvious reason at all. It can be a life-threatening event.
Pneumothorax is usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a chest x-ray, and can sometimes be very difficult to confirm. The problem that this case study is dealing with predicts whether the condition exists in the chest x-ray image given and if present it segments the portion of the lungs that is affected. An accurate prediction would be useful in a lot of clinical scenarios to triage chest radiographs for priority interpretation, or to provide a more confident diagnosis for non-radiologists.
